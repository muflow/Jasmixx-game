# Jasmixx Game

## The Story

The game is a free reinterpretation of one of the most famous video games of all time 'Space Invaders'. Similar structure but different characters.

Jasmixx is the story of a noob programmer who tries to get his code validated by a merciless test machine.

The player, represented by the JavaScript logo, moves horizontally and shoots lines of code that, hitting Jasmixx's spacecrafts, transforms them into green lights.
The player's task is difficult because the enemy ships drop 'X' bombs which risk annihilating him.

The game ends when the player manages to validate his code (all green lights) or die in intent.

A 'Game Over' screen will appear in case the player is hit by an 'X'.
